# Project-1
## By Lauren Marone

### Software Design
This project includes the basics of p5 like variables, setup function, draw function, and drawing shapes, as well as some advanced concepts. I used state machines for each school and its assets: the body text and vector drawings. The "homepage" includes my project title and directions to press the number one on your keyboard. After doing so, the first page for the ballet school will appear. Once in this page, if you click on the screen, the text underneath the school title will rotate through by using an array. Each text box is a fact about the ballet school. Unfortunately, I am getting some glitching as the array wont loop back to zero for some reason. As you go down the line from numbers one to five, you will see each ballet school and its fun facts! I plan to fix my looping problem as well as animate my vector images in some way by Tuesday!


### Reflections
I feel that I did not have enough time to complete this project to my full ability. Like I said above, I will be adding an interaction with my vector images as well as fixing some buggy errors in my project. I enjoyed working on this because I felt like it was much more personal than the weekly assignments are and its always fun sharing something you love with other people! I would love to refine this piece in some way by adding more schools, possibly more interactions, and facts and house it in a web page in the future.
